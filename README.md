# VACCINE-PREDICTION---H1N1-VACCINE
Predict Vaccine Acceptance &amp; Taking based on Independent Variables like  knowledge of both flu, Doctors Recommendations, chronic diseases, behavioral traits etc.

Process – For h1n1 applied Balancing methods like smote, smoten, etc., applied relevant preprocessing like missing imputation and built classification models for prediction. Logistic 
Regression (Precision, Recall, F1 Score), Decision Tree (Precision, Recall, F1 Score), Support 
Vector (Precision, Recall, F1 Score), Naïve Bayes (Precision, Recall, F1 Score), etc. like 
ensemble methods and neural network

Learning – Impact of Imbalance on Models, Balancing Methods like smote, etc. and metrics 
key for Imbalance data like Precision, Recall, F1 Score
